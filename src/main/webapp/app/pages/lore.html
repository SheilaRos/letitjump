    <h3>Johnny: The dancer</h3>
    <!--Imagen de Johnny-->
    <p style="text-align: left">Johnny used to be a normal guy in a normal town in a normal world.<br/>
        He liked everything an 18-year-old likes: driving, playing video games, hanging out with his friends ... One day, while he was in a pub at 3 o'clock in the morning, a hooded man came rushing toward him, seized it and stuck a syringe full of a long-acting hallucinogenic substance.<br/>
        From that day on, Johnny changed completely. He stopped being a normal boy to become a "jumper".<br/>
        Jumpers are creatures whose only purpose in life is to jump without any clear purpose, just run and jump. They tend to look for uneven terrain where they can improve their jumps. <br/>
        This is how he ended up in "Jump Land," a distant Land where jumpers can live in peace, doing what they are made to: jumping.</p>

    <div class="personaje" id="uttem-div">
        <h3>Uttemford: The wizard of Draenor</h3>
        <!--Imagen de Uttemford-->
        <p style="text-align: left">Uttemford was the royal mage of Draenor, a land of antiquity that disappeared years ago.<br/>
            Uttemford was very fond of alchemy and white magic, developing cures, enhancers and spells thanks to the fusion of these two things. Uttemford, however, loved to experiment constantly. One day, trying to create a potion to boost his legs so he could run at the speed of light, something went wrong and his laboratory exploded. Uttemford's corpse was never found.<br/>
            There are several theories about what happened to this poor old man. There are those who say that he escaped and that the explosion was only a plan to do so. Others say the blast opened an interdimensional portal that took Uttemford to another place in the Universe.<br/>
            Be that as it may, Utterford left something behind that explosion, an unfinished potion. This potion proved to be a powerful drug that bend the will of humans to force them to jump without stopping, until the end of their days.<br/>
            It is theorized that Utterford fell into the effect of this drug before disappearing forever, and that if he is alive, wherever he is, he will be jumping for no reason, hoping to find a way back to his beloved Draenor.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="personaje" id="ivan-div">
        <h3>Ivan of Valhalla</h3>
        <!--Imagen de Ivan-->
        <p style="text-align: left">Ivan used to be a great Viking destined to occupy a place with the Gods in Valhalla. He had fought against orcs, vampires, krakens, and any beast you can imagine (even cows). Undoubtedly, Ivan was blessed by the Gods.<br/>
            However, despite having won the paradise, he never knew how to get to heaven. So after years of thinking, he came up with the idea of ​​jumping there (yes, Ivan was not very smart). Then he began to find a way to do it. He spent decades reading books on witchcraft and alchemy, with no result.<br/>
            One day, walking through an old library, a book fell on his head. The book was titled "Spells of Draenor". Ivan read the book without waiting for an answer to the question that had tortured him for so many years. Thanks to the Gods, he was wrong.<br/>
            The book talked about the extinct lands of Draenor, where a powerful wizard was able to create by accident the formula of a potion capable of empowering the legs and being able to jump up to the sky.<br/>
            Ivan set off on a trip to the ruins of Draenor. There he found the answer to all his preaching: the potion that would take him to heaven.<br/>
            Not much more is known of its history, all that remains are theories that speak of its ascent, others that speak of his death in the act. However, we will never know what became of him.</p>

    <div class="personaje" id="lance-div">
        <h3>Sir Lancelot: The jumping knight</h3>
        <!--Imagen de Lancelot-->
        <p style="text-align: left">Sir Lancelot was a noble knight of the Teutonic Order in the service of King Mordred the Great.<br/>
            He was always skilled with the sword, and used to train the king himself, a prodigy in the art of war.<br/>
            Lancelot, however, kept a secret fear of magic. His father died because of this, and that deeply traumatized Lancelot.<br/>
            Over time, magic, which had hitherto been forbidden, was permitted in the kingdom, and its popularity only grew, being taught in schools, and even taught to talented young men in this art.<br/>
            The fear of Lancelot grew more and more with time, until he could not tolerate it more and went to speak with the court doctor, the person who popularized the magic in the kingdom. After an arduous discussion the galene refused to yield to the threats of Lancelot, and threw it of its laboratory.<br/>
            Lancelot promised to take revenge on that old wizard, so when Lancelot was not in his lab, Lancelot changed two packaging ingredients.<br/>
            As the days passed, Lancelot's conscience did not let him sleep, and he decided to go and apologize for any mishap that his act might have generated.<br/>
            When Lancelot was climbing the stairs of the tower where the laboratory was, a big explosion threw the tower down.<br/>
            Lancelot survived, but soon realized that the galenician had disappeared. Feeling guilty, Lancelot left the kingdom in search of the galen, to remote and unknown lands, running like the wind and, eventually, jumping.</p>

    <div class="personaje" id="brian-div">
        <h3>Brian: The hoodie</h3>
        <!--Imagen de Brian-->
        <p style="text-align: left">
            Brian: The hoodie is one of the highest ranking members of a secret religious cult called "The Hooded Jumpers". This cult bases its beliefs on ancient texts that speak of a potion capable of corrupting the will and force any man, whatever his strength, to jump til the end of time.<br/>
            Brian has been fascinated by this story since he was a child, and this led him to join this cult. Brian is one of the chemists of this sect, trying to find the formula of that ancestral potion.<br/>
            A few days ago, he and his team came up with a formula that could be identical to the one spoken by the legends. However, they needed to prove it to someone, and no one from their brotherhood agreed to try it on themselves, as it seemed unworthy to be the first.<br/>
            Knowing the unstable nature of this substance, Brian took his sweatshirt, put on his hood and decided to go in search of the chosen one.<br/>
            That same night, about 3 o'clock in the morning, he found a young boy staggering out of a pub. Without thinking twice, he put the substance in a syringe, ran up to that boy, stuck the syringe and ran until disappeared.<br/>
            Brian did not have the opportunity to see if the potion had any effect, since if he stayed there, they could arrest him.<br/>
            On the way home, Brian was disappointed, as his pursuit of the chosen was a failure. He thought and thought until a pain in his butt broke his thought.<br/>
            Suddenly Brian, not knowing why, bent his legs and ... jumped.
